I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), advised by [Prof. An Wang](https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/an-wang) and co-advised by [Dr. Ouyang Tu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuouyang/). My research focuses on privacy and security in machine learning, specifically investigating privacy leakage and developing privacy-preserving machine learning models and systems. 

Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), where I conducted research on spatial data privacy under the supervision of Prof. Hongyu Xu.
